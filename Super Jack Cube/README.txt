Welcome to Super Jack Cube!
This game stemmed from my interest in making a puzzle game that uses the ideas from super monkey ball. In super monkey ball you don't control the player much, you control the board. So I wanted to experiment with that.
============================================================
Controls:
W and Up arrow - Tilts the board upward
A and Left arrow- Tilts the board to the left
S and Down arrow- Tilts the board downward
D and Right arrow- Tilts the board to the right
Q - Turns the head of the board to the left
E - Turns the head of the board to the right

I noticed in my video that I had left the UI hidden in the third level, the current build has been adjusted to show the score.
